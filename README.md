The motivation behind this plugin
-----------------

I'm an English learner. I usually listen some podcasts and I was trying to dictate those podcasts. Unfortunately, as my type spped is slow and my remembering space is not much, I need to back again and again. So, I made a plugin to controll iTunes from SublimeText. You can write what you hear from iTunes and if you miss some words then you can back your podcast from SublimeText. It means you don't need to go to iTunes apps and go back to your SublimeText.

Have fun and learn a lot.
